# Animated scatterplot of Gapminder data

This project was completed in week 1 of the Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy.

The goal is to recreate an animated scatterplot in the style of [Hans Rosling's](https://youtu.be/fTznEIZRkLg) majestic data visualization on the global evolution of life expectancy, fertility rate, and country population. The data is publicly available on the [Gapminder project website](https://www.gapminder.org/data/).
